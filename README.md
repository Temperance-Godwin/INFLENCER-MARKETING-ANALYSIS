# INTRODUCTION

The objective of this analysis centers on discovering the top-performing UK Youtubers to form marketing collaborations throughout 2024.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Sharon, the Head of Marketing, has found it challenging to identify the top YouTube channels in the UK for marketing campaigns. Her online research is hindered by overly complicated and conflicting insights. Calls with third-party providers have also been unhelpful, as they offer expensive options with underwhelming results. Additionally, the BI reporting team lacks the bandwidth to assist her with this task.

As the Head of Marketing, she needs a dashboard that analyzes YouTube channel data in the UK. This dashboard should enable her to identify the top-performing channels by evaluating metrics such as subscriber base and average views. With these insights, she can make better decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with, ensuring each marketing campaign is as effective as possible.

For this analysis, weâ€™re going to focus on the questions below to get the information we need for our marketing client -

Here are the key questions we need to answer for our marketing client:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?
